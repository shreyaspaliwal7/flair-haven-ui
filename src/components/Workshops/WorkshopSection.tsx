const description2 = `Web development refers to the skill set that enables an individual to be able to design and create a set of webpages called Website .Web development is one of the fastest rising careers and most demanded skill set.
In the modern age, having a strong online presence is critical for businesses to attract and retain customers. Web development has thus become the backbone of marketing, trading
and analysis. Thus, web development is a crucial skill to persuade in the rapidly advancing tech-world.`;

  // 'Bill Gates believes that "A breakthrough in machine learning would be worth ten Microsoft”. Thus, there is no compelling reason to additionally portray the significance of machine learning in this Computer Aided world. Machine Learning has given us self-driving cars, intuitive speech recognition, and an incomprehensibly worked-on grasp of the human genome in the preceding decade. Machine learning is so normal nowadays that you likely use it countless times each day without acknowledging it. ';
